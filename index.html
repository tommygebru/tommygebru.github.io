                <h1>Tommy Gebru</h1>
                <p>Tommy Gebru began web design 4 years ago and is passionate about front-end development. Right now he is working with exciting MVC Frameworks as a Fullstack Developer.</p>
                <p class="quote">"Tommy Gebru is an incredible developer who has a ridiculous ability to learn anything - any design principle, methodology or codebase. Not only does he possess the mindset to do so, he is constantly and purposefully seeking out new ways
                    to improve everything about his workflow to adapt to new challenges. If that means learning something new, Tommy will do it." <span>- Manuel Quintanilla</span></p>
                <p class="quote" style="display:none">"It is my pleasure to commend Tommy on his creativity and expertise in web development. His work reflects a great interest in user interfaces, design patterns, and an eagerness to apply new principles. I have seen firsthand the beautiful
                    designs and mock-ups Tommy has created over the past few months, and with it his growth as a front end developer." <span>- Daniel Lim</span></p>
