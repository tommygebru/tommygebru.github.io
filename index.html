                <h1>Tommy Gebru</h1>
                <p>Tommy Gebru began web design 4 years ago and is passionate about front-end development. Right now he is working with exciting MVC Frameworks as a Fullstack Developer.</p>
                <p class="quote">"Tommy is an incredible developer who has a ridiculous ability to learn anything - any design principle, any methodology, any codebase. Not only does he possess the brain capacity to do so, he constantly, purposefully seeks out new ways
                    to improve everything about his work flow and his problem-solving skills. If that means learning something new, Tommy will do it." <span>- Manuel Quintanilla</span></p>
